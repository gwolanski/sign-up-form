# sign-up-form

This project was completed as part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. The project directions can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form

The Sign-Up Form project was a fun way to put my form and form validation skills to the test in a visually appealing way. Although this project was relatively simple compared to some of my other projects, I'm very happy with the design I came up with and feel it's a great representation of my design skills!

Tools used:
-Forms
-Form validation
-Grid
-Flexbox
